# Core Members
## Purpose of Core Member Role
## Admission and Removal of Role
Expectations:
- Be relatively up-to-date with changes that affect Moderators and Maintainers (alignment)
- Be active in voting on polls and contributing to discussion around topics

What to do if the expectations above aren't met? What's the PIP look like?

Do we need to formalize the voting process in any way? Can anyone initiate a poll for voting, or are we okay with relying on the implicit understanding that anything taken up for a vote is important enough that most of us would agree on taking up a vote? or Simple majority vs. qualified majority/supermajority?
